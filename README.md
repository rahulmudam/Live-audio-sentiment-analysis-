# Live-audio-sentiment-analysis-
implemented in python using IBM node red. where live speech is recorded and simultaneously sentiment is plotted
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of live speech and plot a live graph.We have used Googleâ€™s speech recognition API to recognize the live speech. One is free
to use any other method for speech recognition. We have used Bluemix to plot the live graph of sentiment. One could use any other application to do so. Since Bluemix offers a graphical interface , if
one wants it to be done in programming interface alone feel free to check out dash, bokeh also.
